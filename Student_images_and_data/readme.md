Sharing Data and Photos for Astrobotany Research

This folder is specifically for astrobotany students working with simulated lunar or Martian regolith.

How to Share Your Findings:

File Naming:

Include your initials (First & Last) at the beginning of the filename (e.g., JSmith_Lunar_GrainSizeData.txt).
Next, specify the regolith type (Lunar or Martian).
Finally, indicate the data type (e.g., Photos, GrainSizeData, GerminationRates.xls).
Uploading:

Upload your data files (text documents, spreadsheets, images) to this folder.
Example: JSmith_Lunar_GrainSizeData.txt
This filename indicates:

Data collected by John Smith (JSmith)
Using lunar regolith simulant
The data type is grain size information (GrainSizeData)
Benefits of Clear File Naming:

Easy Organization: Clear file names help you and your classmates easily find specific data.
Identification: Knowing who collected which data ensures proper credit and avoids confusion.
Additional Tips:

Use descriptive data types in the filename (e.g., GerminationRates_PlantsAandB.csv).
If using images, consider including relevant details in the filename (e.g., Lunar_SeedlingGrowth_Day10.jpg).
By following these guidelines, you'll create a well-organized system for sharing your valuable astrobotany research data and photos!
