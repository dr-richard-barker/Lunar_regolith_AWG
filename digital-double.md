# Digital double

Can we use analysis of differential expression of the real regolith to find studies on Earth that are similar using the European Bioinformatics Instiuotes expression atlas data?

[More information on the EBI expression atlas API syntax can be found here](https://github.com/gxa/atlas\_gsa/tree/master)
